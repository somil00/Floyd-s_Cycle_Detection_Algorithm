# Floyd-s_Cycle_Detection_Algorithm
Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds.
This algorithm is implemented here on a linked list which is stored in ROM 2732. 
Two types of registers are used here to store the data of the *fast pointer* and *slow pointe*r used in the algorithm
